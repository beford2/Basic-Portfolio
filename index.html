                <p>I am a student of the Universty of Texas studying Mathematics. Being born in Austin, 
                    studying at the University of Texas was my dream since I was little. I have two siblings, 
                    an older brother, Mithell, and a younger sister, Caroline. I am currently on the Texas Lacrosse 
                    team. I hate to be inside despite the fact that I love to code. When I get the chance to go 
                    backpacking, I don't hesistate to go. I am also a soccer fan who supports Liverpool FC. </p>
